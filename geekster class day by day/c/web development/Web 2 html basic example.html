                        THE DECLARATION 

The  <!DOCTYPE>  declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to 
display web pages correctly. 

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. 

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: 
                                        <!DOCTYPE html>

                    HTML HEADINGS 

        Any document document starts with a heading.

        You can use different sizes for your headings. 

        HTML also has six levels of headings, 
        which use the elements <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>. 

        While displaying any heading, 
        browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

        HTML headings are defined with the <hl> to <h6> tags.

        <hl> defines the most important heading. 
 
        <h6> defines the least important

<!--
     NOTE :- Browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) 
             before and after a heading. 


                HEADINGS ARE IMPORTANT 
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web 
pages. 

Users often skim a page by its headings. 

It is important to use headings to show the document structure. 

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2> headings, 
then the less important , and so on.  



NOTE :-  Use HTML headings for headings only. 
         Don't use headings to make text BIG or BOLD. 



                        BIGGER HEADINGS 
Each HTML heading has a default size. 

However, you can specify the size for any heading with the 'style' attribute, 
using the CSS 'font-size' property: 

                              <hl style="font-size:60px; " >Heading 1</h1> 
-->

<div>  <b>3rd example</b>


    <hl style="font-size:60px;" > This is BIGGER Heading 1 </h1> 

    <h2>This is 2nd heading .</h2>

                            HTML PARAGRAPHS 

    A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text. 

    The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph. 

    A paragraph always starts on a new line, 
    and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) 
    before and after a paragraph .

    The <p> tag offers a way to structur structure your text into different paragraphs.

    Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag.


-->

<div> <b>4th example</b>


        <p>Here is a first paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>Here is a second paragraph of text.</p>
        <p>Here is a third paragraph of text.</p>

<!-- 
                    HTML DISPLAY 
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed. 

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in 
your HTML code. 

The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is 
displayed: 
-->

<div> <b>5th example</b>
    <p>
             This paragraph 
             contains a lot of lines 
             in the source code,

<!-- 
                    LINE BREAK TAG

 The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br>
if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:     
  
Whenever you use the <br /> element,  
anything following  it starts from the next line. 

This tag is an example of an empty element, 
where you do not need opening and closing tags, 
as there is nothing to go in between them.

The <br /> tag has a space between the characters br and the forward slash. 

If you omit this space,
older browsers will have trouble rendering ndering the line break, 
while if you miss the forward slash character and just use <br> 
it is not valid in XHTML. 

-->

<div> <b>6th example</b>

    <p>Hello<br />

<!-- 

                CENTERING CONTENT
You can use <center> tag to put any content in the center of the page or any table cell. 
    
-->

<div> <b>7th example</b>

    <p>This text is not in the center.</p>
<center>
<p>This text is in the center.</p>

</div>


<!-- 
                        HORIZONTAL LINES

 
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, 
and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule. 

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: 
 
Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections sections of a document.

The <hr> tag creates a line from the current position  in the document
 to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly.

For example , you may want to give a line between two paragraphs
 as in the given example below âˆ’  

-->




<div> <b>8th example</b>

    <p>This is paragraph one and should be on top</p>
    <hr />
    <p>This is paragraph two and should be at bottom</p>

<!--
     Again   <hr / >   tag is an example example of the empty element,
     where you do not need opening and closing tags, 
     as there is nothing to go in between them.

     The   <hr />   element element has a space between between the characters 
     hr and the forward slash. 
     
     If you omit this space, 
     older browsers will have trouble rendering endering the horizontal line, 
     while if you miss the forward slash character 
     and just use <hr> it is not valid in XHTML

<!-- 
                        PRESERVE FORMATTING

The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text. 

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: 

Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format 
of how it is written in the HTML document. 

In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag <pre>.

Any text between the opening <pre> tag and the closing </pre> tag 
will preserve the formatting formatting of the source document

Each HTML heading has a default size. 

However, you can specify the size for any heading with the 'style' attribute, 
using the CSS 'font-size' property:

 The HTML < br > element defines a line break.

 Use < br >
 if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

  The < hr > element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page: 
 
  Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections sections of a document.

  The < hr > tag creates a line from the current position  in the document
   to the right margin and breaks the line accordingly.

  For example , you may want to give a line between two paragraphs
   as in the given example below âˆ’  








    < p >   This is paragraph one and should be on top   < /p >
    < hr />
    < p >   This is paragraph two and should be at bottom    < /p >





     Again   < hr / >   tag is an example example of the empty element,
     where you do not need opening and closing tags, 
     as there is nothing to go in between them.

     The   < hr />   element element has a space between between the characters 
     hr and the forward slash. 
     
     If you omit this space, 
     older browsers will have trouble rendering endering the horizontal line, 
     while if you miss the forward slash character 
     and just use < hr > it is not valid in XHTML 
    



                        PRESERVE FORMATTING

 The HTML  < pre > element defines preformatted text. 

 The text inside a  < pre > element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), 
 and it preserves both spaces and line breaks: 

 Sometimes, you want your text to follow the exact format 
 of how it is written in the HTML document. 

 In these cases, you can use the preformatted tag    < pre >.

 Any text between the opening   < pre > tag and the closing   < /pre > tag 
 will preserve the formatting formatting of the source document 






    < pre >
        function testFunction( strText ){
        alert (strText)
        }
        < /pre >
