        WHAT IS HTML?  

     In simple terms, a Web page (or HTML document) is a plain text file that has been 
     encoded using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) so that it appears nicely formatted 
     in a Web browser. Here’s what HTML means, word-by-word:

     ● Hypertext :-  Text that you click to jump from document to document. 
                     This is a reference to the ability of Web pages to link to one another.

     ● Markup   :-   Tags that apply layout and formatting conventions to plain text. 
                     Literally, the plain text is “marked up” with the tags.

     ● Language :-   A reference to the fact that HTML is considered a programming language.
