HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) uses a markup system composed of elements which represent specific
content. 

Markup means that with HTML you declare what is presented to a viewer, not how it is presented. 

Visual representations are defined by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and realized by browsers. 

Still existing elements that allow for such, like e.g. font, "are entirely obsolete, and must not be used by authors"[1].

HTML is sometimes called a programming language but it has no logic, so is a markup language. 

HTML tags provide semantic meaning and machine-readability to the content in the page.

tags are building block of html page.


An element usually consists of an opening tag (<element_name>), a closing tag (</element_name>), which contain the
element's name surrounded by angle brackets, and the content in between:
                        <element_name>...content...</element_name>


There are some HTML elements that don't have a closing tag or any contents. 
These are called void elements.
Void elements include <img>, <meta>, <link> and <input>.

Element names can be thought of as descriptive keywords for the content they contain, such as video, audio,
table, footer.

A HTML page may consist of potentially hundreds of elements which are then read by a web browser, interpreted
and rendered into human readable or audible content on the screen.



For this document it is important to note the difference between elements and tags:
Elements: video, audio, table, footer
Tags:    <video>, <audio>, <table>, <footer>, </html>, </body>

 Element insight
Let's break down a tag... 

The <p> tag represents a common paragraph.
Elements commonly have an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the element's name in angle
brackets (<p>). The closing tag is identical to the opening tag with the addition of a forward slash (/) between the
    opening bracket and the element's name (</p>).

    Content can then go between these two tags: 
                                                <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>

                                        HTML - OVERVIEW

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, anguage, and it is the most widely used language language to write
Web Pages.

Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) documents) are linked together ogether.
Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.

As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply
"mark-up mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.

Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the  structure of documents like
headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate  the sharing of scientifific information between
researchers.

Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available ailable in
HTML language.

                                        HEADINGS

 HTML provides not only plain paragraph tags, but six separate header tags to indicate headings of various sizes and
 thicknesses. 
 
 Enumerated as heading 1 through heading 6, heading 1 has the largest and thickest text while heading
 6 is the smallest and thinnest, down to the paragraph level. This topic details proper usage of these tags.




Headings can be used to describe the topic they precede and they are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags. 

    Headings support all the global attributes
    .
<h1> defines the most important heading.
<h6> defines the least important heading.


Defining a heading:
                    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
                    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
                    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
                    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
                    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
                    <h6>Heading 6</h6>


Correct structure matters
Search engines and other user agents usually index page content based on heading elements, for example to
create a table of contents, so using the correct structure for headings is important.
In general, an article should have one h1 element for the main title followed by h2 subtitles – going down a layer if
necessary. If there are h1 elements on a higher level they shoudn't be used to describe any lower level content.
Example document (extra intendation to illustrate hierarchy):
<h1>Main title</h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
 <h2>Reasons</h2>
 <h3>Reason 1</h3>
 <p>Paragraph</p>
 <h3>Reason 2</h3>
 <p>Paragraph</p>
 <h2>In conclusion</h2>
 <p>Paragraph</p>

    Parameter                   Details                                                                                     

    href                  Specifies the destination address. 

                          It can be an absolute or relative URL, or the name of an anchor. 

                          An absolute URL is the complete URL of a website like http://example.com/. 

                          A relative URL points to another directory and/or document inside the same website, 
                          e.g. /about-us/ points to the directory “about-us” inside the root directory (/). 

                          When pointing to another directory without explicitly specifying
                          the document, web servers typically return the document “index.html” inside that directory.




    hreflang              Specifies the language of the resource linked by the href attribute 
                          (which must be present with this one). 

                          Use language values from BCP 47 for HTML5 and RFC 1766 for HTML 4.




    rel                   Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. 

                          For HTML5, the values must be defined in the specification or registered in the Microformats wiki.




    target                Specifies where to open the link, e.g. in a new tab or window. 

                          Possible values are _blank, _self, _parent, _top, and framename (deprecated). 

                          Forcing such behaviour is not recommended since it violates the control of the user over a website.
    



    title                 Specifies extra information about a link. 

                          The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the cursor moves over the link. 

                          This attribute is not restricted to links, it can be used on almost all HTML tags.




    download              Specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink. 

                          The value of the attribute will be the name of the downloaded file. 

                          There are no restrictions on allowed values, and the
                          browser will automatically detect the correct file extension and add it to the file (.img, .pdf, etc.). 

                          If the value is omitted, the original filename is used.





    Anchor tags are commonly used to link separate webpages, but they can also be used to link between different
    places in a single document, often within table of contents or even launch external applications. 

    This topic explains the implementation and application of HTML anchor tags in various roles

<!-- 

                                                LINK TO ANOTHER SITE :-

    This is the basic use of the <a> (anchor element) element:
                                                                <a href="http://example.com/">Link to example.com</a>

    It creates a hyperlink, to the URL http://example.com/ as specified by the href (hypertext reference) attribute, with
    the anchor text "Link to example.com". 
    
    It would look something like the following:
                                                Link to example.com



    To denote that this link leads to an external website, you can use the external link type:
                                                                                                <a href="http://example.com/" rel="external">example site</a>



    You can link to a site that uses a protocol other than HTTP. 
    
    For example, to link to an FTP site, you can do,
                                                    <a href="ftp://example.com/"> This could be a link to a FTP site </a>

    In this case, the difference is that this anchor tag is requesting that the user's browser connect to example.com
    using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) rather than the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).

    This could be a link to a FTP site.

 -->

                            <a href="http://example.com/"> Link to example.com </a>     <br>

                            <a href="http://example.com/" rel="external"> example site </a>    <br> 

                            <a href="ftp://example.com/"> This could be a link to a FTP site </a>       <br>






<!--  

                                                LINK TO AN ANCHOR :-

    Anchors can be used to jump to specific tags on an HTML page. 
    
    The <a> tag can point to any element that has an id attribute. 
        
    To learn more about IDs, visit the documentation about Classes and IDs. 
    
    Anchors are mostly used to jump to a subsection of a page and are used in conjunction with header tags.

    Suppose you've created a page (page1.html) on many topics:
                                                                <h2>First topic</h2>
                                                                <p>Content about the first topic</p>
                                                                <h2>Second topic</h2>
                                                                <p>Content about the second topic</p>

    Once you have several sections, you may want to create a Table of Contents at the top of the page with quick-links
    (or bookmarks) to specific sections.

    If you gave an id attribute to your topics, you could then link to them
                                                                            <h2 id="Topic1">First topic</h2>
                                                                            <p>Content about the first topic</p>
                                                                            <h2 id="Topic2">Second topic</h2>
                                                                            <p>Content about the second topic</p>
    Now you can use the anchor in your table of contents:
                                                        <h1>Table of Contents</h1>
                                                            <a href='#Topic1'>Click to jump to the First Topic</a>
                                                            <a href='#Topic2'>Click to jump to the Second Topic</a>

    These anchors are also attached to the web page they're on (page1.html). 
    So you can link across the site from one page to the other by referencing the page and anchor name.
 
 
 
    Remember, you can always <a href="page1.html#Topic1">look back in the First Topic</a> for supporting information.

    You can use a relative path to link to pages on the same website.

    <a href="/example">Text Here</a>
                                        The above example would go to the file example at the root directory (/) of the server.

    If this link was on http://example.com, the following two links would bring the user to the same location

    <a href="/page">Text Here</a>
    <a href="http://example.com/page">Text Here</a>

    Both of the above would go to the page file at the root directory of example.com.

                                        LINK THAT DIALS A NUMBER :-

    If the value of the href-attribute begins with tel:, your device will dial the number when you click it.

    This works on mobile devices or on computers/tablets running software – like Skype or FaceTime – that can make phone calls.
    <a href="tel:11234567890">Call us</a>

    Most devices and programs will prompt the user in some way to confirm the number they are about to dial.

<!-- 
                                    OPEN LINK IN NEW TAB/WINDOW :-

    <a href="example.com" target="_blank">Text Here</a>

    The target attribute specifies where to open the link. 
    By setting it to _blank, you tell the browser to open it in a new tab or window (per user preference).

    SECURITY VULNERABILITY WARNING!   :-

    Using target = "_blank" gives the opening site partial access to the window.opener object via JavaScript,
    which allows that page to then access and change the window.opener.location of your page and
    potentially redirect users to malware or phishing sites.

    Whenever using this for pages you do not control, add rel="noopener" to your link to prevent the
    window.opener object from being sent with the request.

    Currently, Firefox does not support noopener, so you will need to use rel="noopener noreferrer" for
    maximum effect.

<!-- 
                                    LINK THAT RUNS JAVASCRIPT :-

    Simply use the javascript: protocol to run the text as JavaScript instead of opening it as a normal link:
    
    <a href="javascript:myFunction();">Run Code</a>



    You can also achieve the same thing using the onclick attribute:

    <a href="#" onclick="myFunction(); return false;">Run Code</a>



    The return false; is necessary to prevent your page from scrolling to the top when the link to # is clicked.

    Make sure to include all code you'd like to run before it, as returning will stop execution of further code.
    
    Also noteworthy, you can include an exclamation mark ! after the hashtag in order to prevent the page from
    scrolling to the top. 
    
    This works because any invalid slug will cause the link to not scroll anywhere on the page,
    because it couldn't locate the element it references (an element with id="!"). 
    
    You could also just use any invalid slug (such as #scrollsNowhere) to achieve the same effect. 
    
    In this case, return false; is not required:
                                                    <a href="#!" onclick="myFunction();">Run Code</a>




    Should you be using any of this?
                                        The answer is almost certainly no.

                                        Running JavaScript inline with the element like this is fairly bad practice. 

                                        Consider using pure JavaScript solutions that look for the element in the page 
                                        and bind a function to it instead. 
                                        
                                        Listening for an event
                                        
                                        Also consider whether this element is really a button instead of a link. 
                                        If so, you should use <button>.

<a href="javascript:myFunction();">Run Code</a>   <br>
<a href="#" onclick="myFunction(); return false;"> Run Code </a>        <br>
<a href="#!" onclick="myFunction();">Run Code</a>       <br>

                                            LINK THAT RUNS EMAIL CLIENT :-

    Basic usage :========>

    If the value of the href-attribute begins with mailto: it will try to open an email client on click:

    <a href="mailto:example@example.com">Send email</a>

    This will put the email address example@example.com as the recipient for the newly created email.



    Cc and Bcc  :=========>

    You can also add addresses for cc- or bcc-recipients using the following syntax:

    <a href="mailto:example@example.com?cc=john@example.com&bcc=jane@example.com">Send email</a>




    Subject and body text  :===========>

    You can populate the subject and body for the new email as well:

    <a href="mailto:example@example.com?subject=Example+subject&body=Message+text">Send email</a>

    Those values must be URL encoded.




    Clicking on a link with mailto: will try to open the default email client specified by your operating system 
    or it will ask you to choose what client you want to use. 
    
    Not all options specified after the recipient's address are supported in all email clients.
