        An HTML form is used to collect user input. 
        The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.
        
       <h2>The   < form>   Element</h2> 
            The HTML    < form>     element is used to create an HTML form for user input:

            < form>
                .
                form elements
                .
                < /form >



    </pre>
    


    <pre>
        The    < label>   Element

            Notice the use of the     < label>     element in the example above.
            
            The    < label>    tag defines a label for many form elements.
            
            The  < label>    element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.
            
            The    < label>     element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.
            
            The for attribute of the     < label>    tag should be equal to the id attribute of the  < input> element to bind them together.
